        <h1>My Life</h1>
        <p>  My life started just like everyone else's, I was carried by my mother in her womb for around 9 months.
             I don't know if I was birthed naturally or by C-section.
            I have been told many times by my parents that I wasn't much trouble as a newborn, no excessive crying, always smiling, 
            the only serious illness I got during my early years was a very high fever.
            I can't help but think maybe my calm and care free temperment was a sign for who I was to become.
