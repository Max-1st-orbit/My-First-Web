        <ul>
        <li>Drawing: Did alot of drawing when I was younger, it was my way of expressing what I couldn't with words and keeping myself entertained.</li>
        <li>Board games: I made a few board games when I was younger, nothing super original but I thought long and hard about how I would implement certain aspects of realtime games into them.</li>
        <li>Story writing: Loved thinking of stories and drawing scenes from them, was terrible at writing, Didn't stop me from trying though.</li>
        <li>Music: I made some music in my later teenage years, mostly Lofi like, video game type music.</li>
