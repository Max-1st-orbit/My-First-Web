        <h1>The works of Max Kapambwe</h1>
        <p>This website exists to display and preserve the works of my hands, Max Kapambwe, a male of african decent with a troubled mind.</p>
        <h2>A brief list of some creative works I have tried</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Drawing: Did alot of drawing when I was younger, it was my way of expressing what I couldn't with words and keeping myself entertained.</li>
        <li>Board games: I made a few board games when I was younger, nothing super original but I thought long and hard about how I would implement certain aspects of realtime games into them.</li>
        <li>Story writing: Loved thinking of stories and drawing scenes from them, was terrible at writing, Didn't stop me from trying though.</li>
        <li>Music: I made some music in my later teenage years, mostly Lofi like, video game type music.</li>
        <li>Video games: Started making video games when I was around 16 years old,First ever game I "finished" was BioTech.</li> 
        </ul>
        <P>I have tried a bunch of other stuff over my time living, never got really good at anything.Better than not trying I guess.Over the years my creative side has slowly suffocated, now I fear my entire person will not last, I have noticed signs of cognitive decay and an overall stuntedness of my emotional and social processing.Anyway enough of that, if you would like to read more about my life you can click the "Max'life" button below.Otherwise please enjoy the other stuff this site provides.</P>
